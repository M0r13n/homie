# Homie - static homepage for all of your services

A simple single static site that gives you an overview of all of your services.

## Why?

I wanted a simple static site, that comes without any databases, Javascript and other bloat. I wanted plain old HTML and CSS. Therefore, the generated
site is perfectly suited to be used in with GitHub/GitLab pages.

The site was loosely inspired by [homer](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer) - but without the need of Docker, NPM, Vue. etc.
